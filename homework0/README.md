# Ross Girshick  
## Introduction  
Ross Girshick is working at Facebook AI Research (FAIR) currently, and he receieved his Ph.D. degree in computer vision at The University of Chicago. He is famous for his contribution on R-CNN (Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation in CVPR.2014) and Fast R-CNN (Fast R-CNN in  ICCV 2015).  
## About his works  
R-CNN architecture was the first oneÂ using region proposal and convolution neural network to detect object location in an image, and R-CNN reached state of the art at that year.And the next year, he proposed a more powerful architecture doing object localization, Fast R-CNN. The features on Fast R-CNN work were in folllowing. First, use ROI pooling for getting the same input size in fully-connected layer. Second, apply multi-task loss function (class score and bounding box regression).Those were amazing parts, because R-CNN can do end-to-end training/testing base on this. It could saved a lot of time. Until today, there are many state of the art networks (such as Faster R-CNN, Yolo, SSD, A Fast RCNN) based on his cotribution in this field.  
## Currently Research  
### visual perception (object recognition, localization, segmentation, pose estimation, ...)  
### visual reasoning (answering complex queries, often in natural language, about images)
